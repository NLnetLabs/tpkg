make the .tpkg.var a PER TEST thingy
we have a test wide master file .tpkg.var.master
that is read by all tests
next tests will have a per test var file which they
use to convey info from pre to test to post, this
lives in the test-dir and gets deleted afterwards
---
update the documentation to reflect to new setup
---
check reverse consistency, file there, but not defined
