don't overwrite result files but add .1 or .2 affix
low prio and then?? so what??

make create smarter. If you give it a directory is looks
into the dir, create the tpkg, moves it up and deletes
the dir.

make the depend smarter, use the TPKG_VAR file for this?
if a test is already done, it should be done again

make a function-lib that can be used in the test-script
to make some things easier
