High Prio:

# really something
make create smarter. If you give it a directory is looks
into the dir, create the tpkg, moves it up and deletes
the dir.


Low Prio:

# usefull, everything is usually run once
don't overwrite result files but add .1 or .2 affix
low prio and then?? so what??

# really? Most test scripts will be perl or C or whatever
# not bash in any case...??
make a function-lib that can be used in the test-script
to make some things easier
