High Prio:

tpkg clone
to clone simular tests

$TPKG_CURRENT and TPKG_BASE and cd ..

Low Prio:



Will not do:
# usefull, everything is usually run once
don't overwrite result files but add .1 or .2 affix
low prio and then?? so what??

# really? Most test scripts will be perl or C or whatever
# not bash in any case...??
make a function-lib that can be used in the test-script
to make some things easier
