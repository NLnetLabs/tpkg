don't overwrite result files but add .1 or .2 affix

export some environment vars. like a tmp dir that
  is used for test and/or checking out code

trap control-c
when creating remove the original files...?

# current working directory
  TPKG_CWD

  make a sourceable temp file with everything you
  want to save

  in $dir: testname.var   # holds the shared variables
  TPKG_TESTDIR=$pwd/$dir
  TPKG_VARFILE=$DPKG_TESTDIR/testname.var

  script can source  $TPKG_VARFILE and have
  all the info

  tpkg defined var
  TPKG_TESTDIR=where is the test shar unpacked
  TPKG_VARFILE=file with all the variables
