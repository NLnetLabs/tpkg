        .test file
                Start each test with a source of the $TPKG_VAR, like
                this:

                [ -f ../$TPKG_VAR ] && source ../$TPKG_VAR

                This is automaticly added when =tpkg tmpl TEST=
                is called.

		We use '../' here cause '.' is cleaned up after
		the test is run


        Each test is executed in a temporary directory, keep this
        in mind when using relative pathnames. ../exe must become
        ../../exe will the test be able to find it.

        Test your test before creating a .tpkg file


Test Output
        
        result. files

                A typical example of a result. file is test:
                
                ** PASSED **     ** PASSED **
                BaseName: svn-build
                Description: Check out and build libdns/trunk
                DateRun: Fri Oct  7 20:28:23 CEST 2005
                --------------- Test Output ------------------




Running Tests:
        Each test is executed in the new temporary directory.
             


        =tpkg exe test1=
        =tpkg exe test2=
        ...
        =tpkg exe testN=

        =tpkg report=
                generate a report of all the tests

        =tpkg clean=
                remove all the result. files

Reading Reports:
        Typical example:

        ldns-splint: ** PASSED ** : Run a make lint test on the libdns sources
        svn-build: ** PASSED ** : Check out and build libdns/trunk

        PASSED: 2 (100.00 %)            FAILED: 0 (0 %)         UNKNOWN: 0 (0 %)






Conventions
        In the toplevel test directory (where all the .tpkg files live) 
        different tests should communicate (exchanges variable contents) 
        by appending to the file "tpkg.var"
        This is currently the only way to implement persistent variabeles.

        The location of this file is known in tpkg as $TPKG_VAR - which is 
        exported when =tpkg= is run.

        It is also wise to name all variables with a "TPKG_" prefix, for
        instance when some test builds the code in a directory, it could
        use a TPKG_BUILD variable that points to that dir.
        The test-script itself should write this var to to the $TPKG_VAR
        file. Like this:

        echo "export TPKG_BUILD=$TPKG_BUILD" >> $TPKG_VAR

        Not the use of '>>' here.

        For each test a .done.TESTNAME file is created when a test is
        performed. When such a .done file is found and matches the
        current test - the test is aborted. This way a test that
        is referenced multiple times via a "Depends"-directive is
        only execute once.

        tpkg cleanup, will remove all these files too.
