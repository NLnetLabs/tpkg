31 Oct 2005: Miek Gieben: 1.03
	* Added status line for tpkg report
	* Cleanup documentation to match .tkpg.var.master
	  and .tpkg.var.test

28 Oct 2005: Miek Gieben: 1.02
	* svnserve doesn't set USERNAME nor LOGNAME, add this
	  to the post-commit script
	* create post and pre file when target is tmpl - 
	  stuff them with stuff handy when running from svn(serve)
	* -q now only prints the errors
	* Use a new system to convey information between the tests
	  and scripts; .tpkg.var.master sets up stuff each test
	  must know. Tests use a .tpkg.var.test file in their
	  local directory to pass info from .pre to .test to .post
	* Allow shorter targets -> exe -> e, extract -> ext, etc.

27 Oct 2005: Miek Gieben: 1.01

	* Don't abort when a pre/post script fails, but
